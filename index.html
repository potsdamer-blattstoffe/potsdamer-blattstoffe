  <b>Submissions guidelines (en):</b>
   <br>
   <br>
  <p>Basic.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The Potsdamer Blattstoffe publish poetry. If a poem is not in English or German, it will be published alongside an English or a German translation acceptable to the author.</p>
    <p>The Potsdamer Blattstoffe publish criticism. It must be criticism of poetry that the Potsdamer Blattstoffe have printed.</p>
    <p>The Potsdamer Blattstoffe publish work by anyone with association to the UP, from employee to volunteer to customer.</p>
    <p>The Potsdamer Blattstoffe don’t publish authors’ names or social media links.</p>
    <p>The Potsdamer Blattstoffe can be one page long (two sides) at most.</p>
    <p>Editions of the Potsdamer Blattstoffe will be published online and displayed and distributed in some way, on a limited print run, for free around the UP (mostly at the Palais Campus).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Complex.
    <br>
    <br>
    Unless there is poetry, there is only the stuffs of the leaf. Blattstoffe proclaim the need for poetry.
    
    The Potsdamer Blattstoffe are pleased to publish works that push against the boundaries of existing artistic sensibilities.
    
    Reappropriating the spirit of Wilde, the Potsdamer Blattstoffe maintain as an ideal that there is no such thing as a moral or immoral poem. A poem is well written or badly written.</p>

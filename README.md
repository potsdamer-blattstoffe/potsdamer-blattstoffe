### My impression of the editor  
From what I’ve seen helping build this site and setup: the editor is careful with design, minimalist in style, and focused on clarity. The editor want things stripped down to essentials — text on a page, nothing more — but also value a bit of elegance. The editor is reflective (sometimes even philosophical) about details like whether to use *that* or *which*, but also practical about getting things working (like GitHub Pages and email links). It gives the whole project a thoughtful but unpretentious atmosphere — exactly right for a student poetry pamphlet.

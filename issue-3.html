<b>September/October Induction</b>


<i>Alexanderplatz</i>

I missed the midday train.
The tower’s eclipse was delayed again.

Behind the frames of a building site
heaven in a reflective vest looked down on us. “Can I take cigarette?”

“Sorry.” I’ve stopped talking to the mad this year.
I rub the black lacquer of the streetlamps now that they’re pre-war.


<i>Grunewald</i>

I saw you this morning inside the train
in the green of the green forest that’s green just like the name

“Tra la this intermezzo, man.”

like every name is green that way and by the same method I caught the vale harpies
in the trees of Grunewald, covered them all just like the vest that stood overhead has covered me.


<I>Sanssouci</I>

Some of these kids will walk into the night, with its grainy madness,
some of these kids will walk over ground, and one of them is me.

But before the Havel, brightly, but after Spree, the gloomy flute
is singing us a lullaby. It knows we’re often going to be using this route.

<b>Choke Me, Joan Didion</b>

The customers have left but now the night
starts with the arrangement of chairs
I prepare. The night is not going to be arranged.

The room is as complete as dayless is the night
filled by the wine-dark or red, dimmed wine
I keep. And every cup I fill I drink now line by line

like gauntlets dropped by drunks on dayless beds,
on decks, and join the odyssey if only to cross
something out. Are we as close as this, black hawk?

Are you the black, the dayless place out on the sea, out on the desert
vale? At least, what does occur, to be delayed or to occur or not to,
performed, but always silently between the brackets of

<i>   (to be performed)</i>	
<i>   (having been performed)</i>	

is work. This is the last room of the gallery.

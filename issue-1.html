<b>grenzer phallus review</b>

in truth, the lovely model allows itself to recall the northern shore

it sits on the white beach and sand in all its glory sentinel over sea and tide

its constant presence lets the cold heart bloom how could you draw

a third from this earth without saluting him oh god

<b>Wozu 605?</b>

These are stations inset.
They had a laird: “wherefore”.
Awhile the mildew of fear
— We aren’t far from our protest —
Lines various rubber forms reset.

How now they are upon
A vehicle inviting us
To love-in-idleness or pansy sonatas,
Beneath or down the wing of a worm’s cobstone.

I, all to do to turn it round, step out
And hold my hand up right.
I am in front like officer or homeless stray.
I am now in the wait of every day.
